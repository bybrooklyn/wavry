## 2. Copyright and License Grant

You retain ownership of your Contribution.

You grant the Project maintainers and downstream users a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license to use, reproduce, modify, display, perform, distribute, sublicense, and create derivative works from your Contribution under the Project's licensing model.
