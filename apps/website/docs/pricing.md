description: Commercial pricing and licensing options for teams using Wavry.
---

Wavry uses a simple split:

- **Open-source path (AGPL-3.0):** free when your use follows AGPL obligations.
- **Commercial path:** for teams that want exclusion from AGPL obligations and/or want to use the hosted Wavry cloud service.

For any commercial questions, contact [contact@wavry.dev](mailto:contact@wavry.dev).

## Open-Source Path (Free)

If you release and operate under AGPL-3.0 obligations, you can use Wavry and the RIFT implementation for free.
