## Is Wavry open source?

Yes. The core project is open source under AGPL-3.0.

## When do I need a commercial license?

Use a commercial license when your use case requires closed-source/private derivative terms that AGPL-3.0 does not satisfy.

## Can I self-host everything?

Yes. Self-hosting is supported and is the default path for teams that want full control.

## What do hosted services provide?

Hosted services can provide auth, matchmaking, and relay convenience so teams can launch faster without operating all control-plane components immediately.

## Is relay always used?

No. Wavry is P2P-first. Relay is a fallback path when direct connectivity is unavailable.

## Where should I start if I am evaluating Wavry?

1. Read [Overview](/docs/overview).
2. Follow [Getting Started](/docs/getting-started).
3. Pick a model in [Deployment Modes](/docs/deployment-modes).
