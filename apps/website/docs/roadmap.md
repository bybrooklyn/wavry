## Current Focus

- Desktop platform stability and packaging reliability.
- Production-grade gateway and relay operations.
- Better distribution ergonomics across Linux, macOS, and Windows.
- Documentation unification for OSS, commercial, and hosted usage.

## Near-Term Priorities

1. Reduce CI runtime through stronger dependency and toolchain caching.
2. Improve cross-platform artifact quality (especially installer/bundle parity).
3. Expand test coverage for security-critical and networking paths.
4. Strengthen release automation with reproducible checksums and signing.
