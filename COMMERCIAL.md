# Commercial License (AGPL Exception)

Wavry is **AGPL-3.0 by default**.

If you need to:
- modify Wavry privately,
- embed it internally,
- ship closed derivatives,
- or avoid AGPL disclosure obligations,

you can purchase a **commercial license** that grants an exception to the AGPL requirements.
