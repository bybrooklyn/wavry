# Wavry Release Artifacts

This document defines the files attached to GitHub releases and the naming rules.

## Naming Convention

Artifact filenames are intentionally explicit:

`<component>-<platform>-<arch>[.<ext>]`

Examples:

- `wavry-gateway-linux-x64`
- `wavry-server-windows-x64.exe`
- `wavry-desktop-tauri-macos-arm64.dmg`
- `wavry-mobile-android-arm64-release.apk`

## Included Components

Backend service binaries (all supported desktop/server platforms):

- `wavry-master-*`
- `wavry-gateway-*`
- `wavry-relay-*`
- `wavry-server-*`

Desktop applications:

- Tauri desktop build:
  - `wavry-desktop-tauri-linux-x64`
  - `wavry-desktop-tauri-windows-x64.exe`
  - `wavry-desktop-tauri-macos-arm64.dmg`
- Native macOS desktop build:
  - `wavry-desktop-native-macos-arm64.dmg`

Android applications:

- `wavry-mobile-android-arm64-release.apk`
- `wavry-quest-android-arm64-release.apk`

Metadata:

- `SHA256SUMS.txt`
- `RELEASE_ASSETS.md`

## Excluded Files

The release workflow intentionally excludes:

- CI intermediate artifacts
- debug/unstripped binaries
- source archives generated by build jobs
- icon/logo sidecar files used only for local `dist/` builds

## Validation Rules

The release workflow fails if required backend binaries are missing:

- `wavry-master-*`
- `wavry-gateway-*`
- `wavry-relay-*`
- `wavry-server-*`

It also generates checksums and an asset manifest for every published release.
