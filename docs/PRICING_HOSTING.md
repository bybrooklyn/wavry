# Suggested Website Copy: Pricing / Hosting

## Wavry Licensing

Wavry is **AGPL-3.0 by default**. That means you can use, modify, and self‑host everything for free.
If you run a modified version as a service, you must publish your changes (standard AGPL behavior).

Need private modifications or closed derivatives? **Commercial licenses are available.**

Contact: `licensing@wavry.example`

## Hosted Services (Auth / Matchmaking / Relay)

We operate an official hosted service for convenience:
- Authentication
- Matchmaking
- Fallback relay

**Personal / non‑commercial use is free and unlimited.**

**Commercial use requires an agreement** (or self‑host under AGPL).

**Official relay limits:**
- 1080p / 60fps / ~10 Mbps per session
- Relay is fallback only (P2P is preferred)

## Community Relays

Community relays are welcome.
- Must register with auth
- Forward traffic only (no identity minting)
- All sessions originate from auth

Auth remains the control plane.
